/*NOTE: You need a public class Main.
Create a package zoo. It needs to contain the following classes:
                        Animal
          Reptile                      Mammal
    Lizard       Snake          Gorilla      Bear
Follow the diagram and create all of the classes. Each of them, except the Animal class,
should inherit from another class. The Animal class should have a field name – String and Getter for a name.
Every class should have:
•	A public constructor, which accepts one parameter: name
